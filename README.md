# Scribble_game
A project based on an online world-wide game played by most of the children, Scribble. It gives user a simple choice to first choose a color from options given in the list ( black color is by default). Then you can use your mouse to draw anything in the space and use "Clear" button to erase it. 
It draws some major programming concepts such as Event Handling and Light Weight programming using AWT and Applet features.
